        This is the most important step! Your log file contains the error details and all the module versions we need to diagnose the problem.

        1.  Find your log file at `C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Roaming\paige\temp\paige.log`
        2.  Drag and drop the `paige.log` file directly into this text box to upload it.
        3.  Alternatively, you can open the file and paste its contents here.

        **Note:** Please review the log for any sensitive information you may wish to remove before uploading.

        Alternatively you can copy and paste a snippet of log contents here, or at the very least mention the current version of each module you are using.
